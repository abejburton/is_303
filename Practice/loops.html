        /*
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter in the number of teams and the number of games played per team. 
        For each game played by each team, you will enter the team score and the opponent's score. 
        You will then determine if the current team won the game and add that to the wins. 
        Once that team's games have been entered, you will calculate the win/loss percentage by using the formula: wins/total number of games. 
        Then display the team name that had the highest win/loss percentage along with their percentage. 
        You can multiply the percentage by 100 to make it look more appealing.
